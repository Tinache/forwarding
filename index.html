  <h1>Freight Forwarding</h1>  
  <img src="forwarding.png" width="600px"><br>

  <p>A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent, is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution.</p>
  <p>Forwarders contract with a carrier or often multiple carriers to move the goods. </p>
  <p>A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in the logistics network.</p>
  <p>The carriers can use a variety of shipping modes, including ships, airplanes, trucks, and railroads, and often use multiple modes for a single shipment. For example, the freight forwarder may arrange to have cargo moved from a plant to an airport by truck, flown to the destination city and then moved from the airport to a customer's building by another truck. </p>
  <p>International freight forwarders typically handle international shipments and have additional expertise in preparing and processing customs documentation and performing activities pertaining to international shipments. </p>
